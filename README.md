# README
APOLLO (Automated Public Outbreak Localization through Lexical Operations) is a Natural Langauge Processing (method in artificial intelligence) tool for detecting potential outbreaks from the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) for potential organizations and locations to assist in contact tracing efforts and reduce the burden on the health departments. The current version of our classifier is able to extract large amounts of surveillance data and summarize a report to highlight potential outbreaks and their associated addresses. The report was designed in weekly intervals by county so a systematic approach can be shared for any county in the state of Wisconsin.
