## Create list of IncidentID data
First, create a list with the format
| IncidentID | Address | City | Zip | County | CensusBlock | CensusTract | Latitude | Longitude |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

using the python script [parse_patient_addresses.py]()

Then, select only the incidentID, latitude, and longitude:

    cat dataList | cut -d\| -f1,8,9 > dataList_latlon.txt
