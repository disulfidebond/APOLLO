# Overview
This writeup describes the workflow for location mapping, updated 04-20-2021. Links to python scripts are included, and bash or sed commands are written inline.

# Prep
These steps are standalone, and will not be incorporated into the main python file.
## Create list of IncidentID data
First, create a list with the format
| IncidentID | Address | City | Zip | County | CensusBlock | CensusTract | Latitude | Longitude |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

using the python script [parse_patient_addresses.py](https://github.com/disulfidebond/APOLLO/blob/main/loc_mapping/parse_patient_addresses.py)

Then, select only the incidentID, latitude, and longitude for use in the location mapping steps:

    # bash
    cat dataList | cut -d\| -f1,8,9 > dataList_latlon.txt
    # note this will leave missing values, you can also do this in python
    
    # python
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('NLP_Patient_file.txt', sep='|')
    df = df.dropna(subset=['Latitude', 'Longitude'])
    df.to_csv('NLP_Patient_file.dropNA.txt', sep='|', index=False)
